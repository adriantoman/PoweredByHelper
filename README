I have migrated this project to Ruby Version 1.9.3 because some of dependent ruby Gems.

One of the dependencies is Nokogiri Gem, which could cause some installation issues on some specific operating systems.

If you are experiencing some installation problems connected to Nokogiri, try to look here: http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html
